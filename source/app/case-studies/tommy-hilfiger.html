    Tommy Hilfiger wanted to seriously ramp up the excitement of London Fashion Week (LFW). The idea
    was to give passers-by its flagship store on Regents Street the chance to win prizes on an over-sized slot machine.
    To boost the buzz, liking and sharing, Tommy wanted its machine to countdown to LFW launch day.

    Random Quark was immediately onboard with bringing magic into so many people’s lives – and we knew we had the right
    technology to make it happen.

  <p>To help Tommy see them coming, RQ hid sensors behind stickers on the other side of the window.

  <p>Touch-sensitive glass meant people could play on the vast LED screens without having to enter the shop as well as
    being rain resistant. Ha,
    weather you will not stop the fun!
  </p>

  <p>RQ created installation graphics in C++ and used web technologies at the back-end ticketing machine API, so that
    the slot machine ran as fast as possible. The capacitive sensors on the touch interface were implemented with Bare
    Conductive’s touchboards.</p>
