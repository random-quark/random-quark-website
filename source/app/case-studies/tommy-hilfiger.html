    Working for <a href="http://omm.agency">creative agency OMM</a> we developed for Tommy Hilfiger a public game that was featured in their flagship store on London’s famous Regent Street. Passers-by played with a giant slot machine on a touch-sensitive window front in order to win prizes in the build-up
    to London Fashion Week. Thousands of people had a chance to play the game and win prizes in its two week run.

    Giant LED screens that hosted the slot machine game were installed behind the window front. To interact with them seamlessly we used capacitive sensors which were hidden behind stickers in the inside of the glass. This means that the fun continued irrespective
    of weather and crowd conditions and the game was resistant to damage. The graphics for the installation were written in C++ in order to optimise for speed and for backend we used web technologies to communicate with the ticketing machine API. The
    touch interface was implemented using Bare Conductive’s Touchboards.
