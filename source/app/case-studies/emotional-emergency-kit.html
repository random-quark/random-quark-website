    Random Quark was commissioned by Goldsmiths Library to come up with a
    creative way to measure the emotional state of the students from day to day.
    Random Quark developed the Emotional Emergency Mirror, an interactive
    installation which playfully collects emotional data from its users by
    blending the virtual with the real.

    Users of the library submit how they feel at that particular moment by
    pressing one of the emotional buttons. They then act on a virtual
    representation of their emotion by using physical objects. They drown their
    sorrow using a real water tap, they put out their anger with a fire
    extinguisher, they inflate their happiness with a bike pump and they hoover
    it all up by using a real hoover.

  <p>
    As students use the installation the library collects anonymised information
    about how the average student feels, particularly during the stressful
    months of the year, and can flag up any concerns with the university student
    wellbeing team.
