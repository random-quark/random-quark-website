    In partnership with Italian studio <a href="http://http://interfase.it/">Interfase</a> we built an interactive exhibit for the exhibition “Maria Teresa and Trieste” that allows visitors to discover the history of trading routes to the port of Trieste
    in north Italy. Information about imports, exports and connections to the rest of the world are presented in an informative, engaging, physical way that feels magical. Museum visitors picks up a jar containing a trade route product such as coffee,
    oil or soap and they activate interactive animations relating to that product. on a projection. This seamless interaction was achieved by using sophisticated technology that is completely hidden from the visitors yet works completely smoothly.

  <h3>Technology</h3>
  <p>
    The installation uses ten RFID readers to monitor the status of each of the tags applied to the jars that can be handled by users of the installation. The readers continually read each tag to test presence of the jar. If a read fails, the installation
    knows which jar has been removed and will display the appropriate information to the user. The front-end component of the interactive installation was done using javascript (React.js). Communication between the hardware (arduino) and the software
    was achieved using websockets and serial communication.
