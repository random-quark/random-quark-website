  <h2>Computational stroboscopic photography</h2>
  <h2>Client: IMG Live</h2>
  <p>
    We created an installation that allowed people to turn their golf swing into
    a unique artwork that they could share on social media. Players took a
    moment to step into IMG Live's specially constructed booth at The Open to
    record themselves taking a swing. Their artwork was generated and emailed
    within seconds and is available for them to see in person.

    We brought innovative computational techniques to the art of stroboscopic
    photography. Standard stroboscopic photography is achieved with a long
    exposure time and repeated flashes. We used a high speed camera to stitch
    together a photo that looked completely new. Whereas conventional
    stroboscopic photography can capture a maximum of around 20 frames, we were
    able to create a composite of 100, tracking every position of the golf
    swing.

    We built an automated system to create the images so that the installation
    could be staffed with minimal training.

    The whole installation was conceived of, designed and delivered in under a
    month.
